#NOT RELEASED! Still in development



##pimatic-arduino-manager
=======================

Plugin to update the Software for every "Arduino" connected to Pimatic.

This handles software updates on our Arduinos.
![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Icesory/pimatic-arduino-manager/master/arduino-updater-sch.jpg)

### For Users
=======================

As an User you must only add arduino-updater to your plugin list in pimatic.
After that all Plugins which supports the arduino-updater can now update the software on their arduinos.

```json
    {
      "plugin": "arduino-updater"
    }
```

####You like control?

You can add a plugin to the blacklist and it isnt allowed to upload new sketch files.
```json
    {
      "plugin": "arduino-updater",
      "blacklist": [
        "rflink",
        "homeduino"
      ]
    }
```
A little bit to hard?
Alternativly you can block plugins from the automatic functions.
Now you must allow every update in the GUI.
```json
    {
      "plugin": "arduino-updater",
      "blacklist": [
        "rflink"
      ],
      "autoUpdateBlacklist": [
        "homeduino"
      ]
    }
```

Did you install arduino-updater all plugins, which support it should ask now for an
specific arduino board.

```json
    {
      "plugin": "homeduino",
      "driver": "serialport",
      "driverOptions": {
        "serialDevice": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
        "baudrate": 115200,
        "board": "nano328"   <--- This entry is now neccessary
      },
      "receiverPin": 1,
      "transmitterPin": 4
    },
```
The plguin should provide you a list with supportet boards. RFLink for example supports only Arduino Mega boards.

### For Developer
=======================

Your plugin must provide some functins and it must register it self in arduino-updater to got recognized.

Following the example fo Pimatic-Homeduino
```coffeescript
    _registerArduUpdater:()=>
      #Check for real Arduino config
      if @config.driver is "serialport"
        #Wait for all plugins get loaded
        @framework.on "after init", =>
          #Get arduino-manager plugin
          arduUpdater = @framework.pluginManager.getPlugin("arduino-updater")
          #Check if it is installed
          if arduUpdater?
            #Get all supported boards. These are the different Uploader
            arduinos = arduUpdater.getSupportedBoards()
            #Create string from Mapping keys for Users
            boards = (key for key, val of @supportedArduBoards)
            #Check if an board type is set
            unless @config.driverOptions.board?
              env.logger.warn("You have installed pimatic-arduino-updater but you havenÂ´t "+
                              "specified a Arduino board for Homeduino. "+
                              "Supported boards are: #{boards.join(", ")}")
            #Check if the configured board type is supportet.
            else if @supportedArduBoards[@config.driverOptions.board] not in arduinos
              env.logger.warn("You have specified a unsupported Arduino board. "+
                              "Supported boards are: #{boards.join(", ")}")
            #register this plugin to arduino-updater
            else
              #returns true for success and false for failure(blacklist)
              @arduUpdaterReg = arduUpdater.registerPlugin(@config.plugin)
```

Your plugin must also provide an special function called "arduinoUpdate". This function is called by the arduino-updater in case of User interaction.

```coffeescript
    #This function will be called from the arduino-updater to determin a necessary update
    arduinoUpdate:()=>
      #Generate Path to hexfiles. First get this plugin path
      pluginPath = @framework.pluginManager.pathToPlugin("pimatic-"+@config.plugin)
      hexFilePath = pluginPath+"/arduino/Homeduino_"+@config.driverOptions.board+".hex"
      state = {
        update:false
        port: @config.driverOptions.serialDevice
        board: @supportedArduBoards[@config.driverOptions.board]
        file: hexFilePath
      }

      #Your plugin should determine if it neccessary to update the arduino
      #If true then disconnect your serial port! HIGHLY Important
      #and change the update state to true. arduino-updater will now update your arduino for you
      if UPDATE
        @board.disconnect()
        state.update = true

      return state
```
#####This is still in development. The callback isnt implemente at the moment!!

Your plugin must provide also ALL possible hex files for all Arduinos. To simplifie this @leader21
has created an bash script, which compiles your arduino .ino sketch to all defined boards.


```
#!/bin/bash
################################################################################
################################################################################
#
# this script compiles arduino files to hex files and stores them
# for the pimatic-arduino plugin for automatic update procedure.
#
# created by leader21 for the pimatic home automation project
# version 0.1
#
# usage   : sudo ./MakeAll
#
# the Makefile needs to be adapted to your needs.
# the script parses the Makefile and changes the BOARD_TAG for itself
#
# all hex files will be stored in the DESTINATION_PATH directory as well as in the builds
#
################################################################################

#Set the hexfile Prefix here. A good string would be "PLUGIN_Arduino".
#The compiled file looks like this "PLUGIN_Arduino_pro328.hex"
TARGET_FILE_PREFIX="Homeduino"

#Set your target directory here. Normally a directory in your Pimatic plugin.
DESTINATION_PATH="/home/USER/pimatic-dev/node_modules/pimatic-homeduino/arduino"

# declare for which boards the arduino file should be compiled
boards=(diecimila leonardo mega2560 mini328 mini nano328 nano pro328 pro5v328 pro5v pro uno)


# check if the upload directory exists, if not create it
echo "Your Arduino code will be compiled into $DESTINATION_PATH"
if ! [ -d $DESTINATION_PATH ]
  then
    mkdir $DESTINATION_PATH
    echo "created destination directory"
  else
    echo "destination directory already exists"
fi
sleep 2

# for every board the below loop will be executed once, files will be stored in the upload directory
for board in ${boards[@]}
  do
    echo -e "\n$board will be compiled now"
    sleep 2
    sed -i "s/BOARD_TAG\s\+=\s\+\w\+/BOARD_TAG = $board/g" Makefile
    make
    cp build-$board/*.hex "$DESTINATION_PATH/""$TARGET_FILE_PREFIX""_${board}.hex"
    echo "done with compiling of $board"
  done
ls -l $DESTINATION_PATH
echo -e "\nthe hex files have been compiled and can be found in the $DESTINATION_PATH directory"
exit
```
To use this script you need to install arduino-mk. There are many examples to archieve this.
Example for homeduino.

1.
Install libs
```
sudo apt-get install arduino-core avr-libc avrdude binutils-avr gcc-avr libconfig-yaml-perl libftdi1 libyaml-perl screen python-serial
```
2. clone homeduino
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pimatic/homeduino.git
```
3.
Copy the MakeAll skript into the created directory and configure it.
now run
```
./MakeAll
```

But we have now a mismatch between the compiled files and the arduino-uploader.
The uploader supports these boards.
"uno", "nano", "mega", "leonardo", "micro", "duemilanove168", "blend-micro"
"tinyduino", "sf-pro-micro", "qduino", "pinoccio", "imuduino", "feather"

But compiled files are for
"diecimila" "leonardo" "mega2560" "mini328" "mini" "nano328"
"nano" "pro328" "pro5v328" "pro5v" "pro" "uno"

To match these boards with the uploader we use an mapping array, which must be stored in your
plugin or can be get from arduino-updater.

```coffeescript
      #This is our uploader mapping. The key (left) value represents the arduino gcc hex file.
      #The value (right) is the used uploader. You can see we used often the nano uploader.
      @supportedArduBoards = {
        "uno": "uno"
        "mega": "mega"
        "mega2560": "mega"
        "leonardo": "leonardo"
        "micro": "micro"
        "nano328": "nano"
        "nano": "nano"
        "pro328": "nano"
        "pro5v": "nano"
        "pro5v328": "nano"
        "pro": "nano"
        "diecimila": "duemilanove168"
      }
```

You can now simple pass the user defined board tag to this mapping and you get the neccessary
uploade type.

```coffeescript
@supportedArduBoards[@config.driverOptions.board]
```
